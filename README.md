# WPF-Automata

WPF Automata Solution contains two projects

* CYKAlgorithmLibrary
* TuringLibrary
* Strenuous Automata

## CYKAlgorithmLibrary

CYKAlgorithmLibrary is developed to solved [CYK Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm). This can be integrated in .Net application to check whether a string is part of grammar or not. Input must be in [Chomsky Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_normal_form).

## TuringLibrary

For now it only contains the subtraction portion 

## Strenuous Automata

Strenuous Automata is a WPF Application which integrated the 'CYKAlgorithmLibrary' project and produces results in a right-angled triangle form.
